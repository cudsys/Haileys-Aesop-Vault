# lilac path
You: I know an app that might help you with that
Lilac: *tilts their head* $v_lilac[wait, really?]
You: Yeah, it's called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It's a note taking app, but it also has a lot of useful features for people who struggle with note organisation.
Lilac: $v_lilac[oh sick! let me just...]
Lilac: $v_lilac[...where's my phone?]

The gang disperses, looking in between cushions, under couches, behind books
Lilac: *sigh*$v_lilac[it's not here]
Avery: *throws a blanket on the couch* $v_avery[or here]
Max: *restacks magazines* $v_max[not here either]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You walk back from the tea station, empty handed
You: yeah, it's not over there either.
Avery: $v_avery[biscuit, did you drop it on the way here?]
Lilac: *head in her hands* $v_lilac[sure hope not...]

[["I'll go look for it"]]
[["maybe try retracing your steps?"]]
[["I could call it?"]]

## going to look for lilac's phone
You: I'll go look for it
Lilac: *head up* $v_lilac[you sure?]
You: yeah, of course!
Lilac: *smiles* $v_lilac[thanks! stay safe, we'll keep looking around here]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You head out of the summit and start moving from one floor to another.
After a few minutes of investigation, you make your way to a balcony next to one of the escalators.
Look, maybe Lilac went out here to look at the view before?
Man, it would've been easier if she had just gone and retraced their steps rather than you just walking around and hoping you're doing the same thing.
You let out a sigh.
Maybe you should go back and-

???: $v_evan[looking for something, are we?]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You look to your left and see
Evan.
Throwing a phone into the air and catching it.
Mother-

You: Oh come on, you? Again?
Evan: *smirks* $v_evan[don't sound so disappointed!]
You: Come on man, just give me the phone.
Evan: $v_evan[Give me one reason why I should, and make it good. Or this phone goes over the edge.]

[Dialogue]

Evan: $v_evan[...]
Evan: $v_evan[alright, fine. You make a *surprisingly* good point. You can have it]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You start walking over to grab Lilacs phone.

Evan: $v_evan[BUT!]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=You stop

Evan: $v_evan[...on *one* condition.]
Evan: *his lips curl into a toothy grin* $v_evan[*you* have to do *something* for me.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
He pulls his phone out of his pocket and points it at you.
You hear a beep.

Evan: $v_evan[Repeat after me.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You swallow.
What is he going to make you say?
Is he recording this?

- mc: I'll go look for it
 - lilac: you sure?
 - mc: yeah of course
 - lilac: thank you! stay safe
 - you start looking around outside of the summit. after a couple of minutes of looking you still have no luck. but then...
 - you go over to one of the balconies next to the escalator.
 - Evan: looking for something now, are we?
 - you look to your left/right and see Evan, tossing up and then catching a phone. you catch a glimpse of the lock screen and see lilac, Avery and a third person. it isn't max, but they seem (if has one of the Elle endings) like someone you would know (otherwise) like another friend of the group.
 - mc: oh c'mon, you again!?
 - Evan: [some snarky villainous reply]
 - mc: come on man just give me the phone.
 - Evan: give me one reason why I should, and make it good.
 - choice of dialogue that doesn't change the ending goes here. I'll expand on this later.
 - Evan: ..... alright, fine. you make a (smol text that may also change with the above choice)[surprisingly] good point.
 - you start walking over to receive lilac's phone
 - Evan: BUT! _halts you_ on one, last, condition.
 - an uncomfortably evil grin begins to grow on Evan's face as he unlocks the phone and opens the camera app. he points the phone at you.
 - Evan: repeat after me.
 - the thought of what he's trying to achieve here sends multiple chills throughout your body.
