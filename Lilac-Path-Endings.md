You: What is this for?
Evan: $v_evan[You want her phone back?]
You: ..yes.
Evan: $v_evan[Then repeat. After. Me. Got it?]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You slowly nod your head.
Evan grins.

Evan: $v_evan[Fantastic! Let's begin: I am...]
You: *slowly* I am...
Evan: $v_evan[...a completely normal...]
You: ...a completely normal...
Evan: $v_evan[...straight, cisgender, person.]
You: ...what?!
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Evan inches towards the edge of the balcony, and holds Lilac's phone over the expanse.
He smirks as he gestures for you to continue.

You: ...straight, cisgender, person.
Evan: $v_evan[I am happy being this way.]
You: I...am happy... being-
You: -this way.
Evan: $v_evan[I am not a part of the LGBT+ community, and I denounce what they stand for.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You're really doing this.
You dedicated your day to figuring this out.
And this is how it's ended up.

You: I-I..I am not a part of the LQBT+ community, and I...
You: I denounce what they stand for.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You didn't think this would hurt.
You thought they were just, words.
But to hear yourself say it, when you were so close, crushes you.
It sounds, so familiar...

(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You can feel your fire leave your body.


Evan: $v_evan[annnnd cut!]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
He throws Lilac's phone to you.
You barely catch it.

Evan: $v_evan[Take care, my fellow cishet! I'll be seeing you around!]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
He walks past you.
You hear some words being spoken behind you.
You stare into the cityscape.

???: $v_avery[yo! What happened?]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You turn around.
The gang is here.

Avery: *eyes widen* $v_avery[hey, what happened?]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You feel your eyes become wet.
You vision becomes distorted.

Max: *places his hand on your shoulder* $v_max[hey! hey, it's fine! It's just, Evan, right? don't listen to him.]
You: ..but-but I...
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Lilac's phone dings with a new notification.

Lilac: $v_lilac[..hey! you found my phone!]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You hand it over to her.
You see Evan sent her a video.
Your heart sinks.

You let your knees carry you to the ground.
You feel warmth to your left and right.

The lump in your throat becomes more noticeable.

Avery: $v_avery[hey! hey, it's ok! You're fine, Evan's gone]
Max: $v_max[yeah! yeah, you're ok, you're fi-]

???: I am a... completely normal, straight, cisgender person.

Your gaze shifts up to see Lilac looking at her phone with horror.

???: I, am happy being this way.

Both Avery and Max look at each other.
Then hug you tighter on your sides.

You: I am not a part of the LQBT+ Community.

[Remember]

## Remember
You remember yourself in your bedroom, looking at yourself in the mirror.
You're younger here, but it's still you.
You: yeah! yeah no, I'm normal. I'm just overcomplicating things.
You: yeah yeah yeah.
You: ...
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You walk towards the mirror, looking yourself up and down.

You: I am normal.
You: I'm, me!
You: I'm...
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You stop.
You clench your fists.

You: I'm *happy* being this way.
[Return]

## Return
The lump in your throat is let out in sobs. The warmth to your left and right gently hold you close as you revisit that memory.
It's all too much.
It's all too little.
But, you're here.
and, this is all too empty.

You know Evan made you say those things.
You know you shouldn't care too much.
But it doesn't retract from the impact and meaning behind those words.

You body falls to the floor.
You're crying, but you don't feel anything other than defeat.
Of having being bested.
Of not showing pride in who you are.

- she shows the group the video as you collapse to the ground. you lie there with no thoughts. no sadness, no anger, no emotion, nothing. you know it's just a video where someone else puts words into your mouth, but you know that it's more than that.
