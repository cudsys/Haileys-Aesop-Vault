**Quote:** 

Samantha, also known as the "Bus Stop Frog Witch," is a whimsical and enchanting character who frequently appears at the Bus Stop in the game. This character is a delightful cameo based on Samantha, one of the creator's friends. Samantha adds a touch of magic and unpredictability to the player's journey of self-exploration and understanding.

# Appearance
Samantha is a charming and mystical frog with a unique sense of style. She can often be seen wearing a small traffic cone as a hat, which has become her signature accessory. Originally a rare event, the traffic cone hat replaced her small witch hat but quickly became a permanent part of her enchanting look. The humorous play on words, referring to a traffic cone as a "witch's hat," adds an element of amusement and light-heartedness to her character.

# Personality
Samantha embodies a cheerful and whimsical nature. As the Bus Stop Frog Witch, she exudes a sense of magic and mystery, captivating the main character and players alike. Samantha is known for her friendly and approachable demeanour, always eager to engage in conversations and offer her unique perspective on various matters. Whether providing magical advice or simply engaging in light-hearted banter, Samantha's presence adds a touch of warmth and humour to the game.

# Interests
Samantha has a deep fascination with time and its mysterious nature. She enjoys contemplating the intricacies of the player's journey and the impact of their choices across different runs. Through her conversations, players can gain unique perspectives on their experiences and the overarching themes of self-discovery and sexuality exploration.

# Story
Samantha's presence at the [[bus stop]] is not just a delightful coincidence. As a cameo of Samantha, a friend of the game's creator, she brings a touch of familiarity and personal connection to the game. Her character provides a whimsical twist and a meta narrative that ties into the concept of multiple runs and the player's journey of self-discovery.

## Purpose
While talking to Samantha is mostly optional, there are times during the game where it is required to talk to her as she reveals important information, including how to get the true ending.

### 4th run
During the 4th run, Samantha will croak at [[You|MC]] for their attention. The story doesn't progress until the player talks to her. Samantha talks about how she's "a good friend of time" and that she "knows of where you've been and where you can go". When asked what any of it means, she assures [[You|MC]] that all will make sense in due time.

### 1 normal ending left
When 8 endings (excluding special endings) are obtained, Samantha croaks for [[You|MC]]'s attention again. This time, she tells them that she's "well acquainted with your predicament and has found out a way to help". From there, the player needs to get the last normal ending.

### All normal endings obtained
When all 9 normal endings are obtained, Samantha will appear in [[You|MC]]'s [[bedroom]] instead of being at the [[bus stop]]. She tells them that "you're not the only one who's tired of dealing with labels". She then hints at how to obtain [[Endings/Main story/Hailey's Aesop|the true ending]] and then vanishes, leaving it to the player to finish the game.

# Trivia
- This isn't the first time Samantha was at least planned to cameo in a game made by Hailey. In the now discontinued project *Hailey's Puzzle Dimension*, Samantha would appear at the beginning of the game yet again as a frog witch to give the player the first proper puzzle.
