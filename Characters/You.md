> [!important] VERY Important
> Please remember the following:
> - The player character has **no canon gender**. The main true ending is obtainable regardless of gender.
> - The player character has **no canon height, weight, skin tone, religion, alignment, etc**.
> - ***ASIDE FROM ALL CHARACTERS IN THE STORY BEING AT LEAST 18 YEARS OR OLDER,*** the player character has **no canon age, *but it is assumed that the oldest the character can be is 22***.
>
>While keeping up a barrier between the player and the player's character, these details can bleed into the game if personal immersion is necessary. However, these variations of the player character are and always will be non-canon.

# Story
The player appears in every route and ending, so this section will be presented in a sort of reversed fashion whilst going into detail what the player can do to alter the story.

## Reflect
**Reflecting** allows the player to specify their gender in two parts. First, the player physically reflects by looking at their body in the mirror to acknowledges its features. It is at this point that the player can decide what **assigned sex** they wish to be canon for the current run. After which, they mentally reflect, allowing the player to decide on the player character's **gender identity**. This system allows you to be cisgender, transgender, nonbinary and intersex. While some endings can be achieved with all genders, other endings are gender-exclusive.

### Possible reflection combinations
