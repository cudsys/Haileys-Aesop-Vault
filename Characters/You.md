> [!important] VERY Important
> Please remember the following:
> - The player character has **no canon gender**. The main true ending is obtainable regardless of gender.
> - The player character has **no canon height, weight, skin tone, religion, alignment, etc**.
> - ***ASIDE FROM ALL CHARACTERS IN THE STORY BEING AT LEAST 18 YEARS OR OLDER,*** the player character has **no canon age, *but it is assumed that the oldest the character can be is 22***.
>
>While keeping up a barrier between the player and the player's character, these details can bleed into the game if personal immersion is necessary. However, these variations of the player character are and always will be non-canon.

# Appearance
Aside from the ability to identify their gender and choose an outfit, the player has no canon appearance. The player character's height, weight, skin tone, etc. are all at the mercy of the player's imagination.

# Personality


# Interests
The player character's interests vary between runs, but the only constant is that they prefer pre-mixed alcoholic drinks.

# Story
The player appears in every route and ending, so this section will be presented in a sort of reversed fashion whilst going into detail what the player can do to alter the story.

## Reflect
**Reflecting** allows the player to specify their gender in two parts. First, the player physically reflects by looking at their body in the mirror to acknowledges its features. It is at this point that the player can decide what **assigned sex** they wish to be canon for the current run. After which, they mentally reflect, allowing the player to decide on the player character's **gender identity**. This system allows you to be cisgender, transgender, nonbinary and intersex. While some endings can be achieved with all genders, other endings are gender-exclusive.

### Possible reflection combinations

|                          | **Male body parts** | **Female body parts** | **Both body parts**        |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Masculine feelings**   | Cis Male            | Trans Male            | Masc-leaning Intersex      |
| **Feminine feelings**    | Trans Female        | Cis Female            | Fem-leaning Intersex       |
| **Androgynous feelings** | Nonbinary           | Nonbinary             | Nonbinary AND/OR Intersex  |
| **No feelings**          | Agender OR Demiboy  | Agender OR Demigirl   | Agender AND/OR Intersex    |

## Wardrobe
The player is able to choose from different **outfits** from their **wardrobe** before leaving their house. Each outfit has certain effects on the story, ranging from adding/removing/altering dialogue all the way to being required to obtain endings.
- [ ] TODO: make page for outfits in the future
### PJs
These are pyjamas that the player wears by default at the beginning of the game.
#### Changes
- **Dialogue**
	- People have a slightly high chance to point out that you're still wearing PJs.
	- [[Elle]] will make a joke about sleepovers, but also say that she wouldn't mind having one if the day turns out well.
- **Departing**
	- If the player tries to **depart** without opening their **wardrobe**, the game will remind them that they're still in their PJs and that they should look at their **wardrobe**.
	- If the player HAS opened their **wardrobe** at least once but are still wearing the PJs, the game will prompt them if they really want to **depart** while wearing PJs.
- **Endings**
	- The player is able to obtain **sleepy endings** by going to locations with beds or the ability to lie down.

### Casual clothes
These clothes are super cas and are considered the most regular clothes you can wear, useful for discovering new routes and endings without the risk of altered dialogue.
#### Changes
- **Dialogue**
	- Dialogue is at its most default with this outfit. HOWEVER...
	- Looking in the mirror while wearing this outfit has a \[low]% chance of the game calling you "super cas".
		- Getting this dialogue activates a flag that causes bonus dialogue to appear. A notable example is [[Elle]] offering you a "fun size Twix".
- **Endings**
	- All non-outfit-exclusive endings are obtainable with this outfit.
