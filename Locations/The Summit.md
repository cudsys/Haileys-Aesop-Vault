# Overview
The Summit is a vibrant and popular hangout spot situated atop City Mall. Originally conceived as an art installation, it quickly gained attention and transformed into a dedicated gathering place for queer individuals. Its allure lies not only in its picturesque setting but also in the sense of community it fosters.

# Appearance
The Summit boasts a mesmerizing view of the cityscape, with sprawling skyscrapers and twinkling lights stretching out in every direction. The area is adorned with colorful decorations and cozy seating arrangements, creating a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. Graffiti art, affirming messages, and pride flags add to the vibrant aesthetic of the space.

At the center of The Summit, proudly flying high, is a vibrant red flag symbolizing unity and resilience. This iconic flag, along with the whimsical flying strawberry stickers that surround it, serves as a homage to the popular game Celesteâ€”a beloved title embraced by many queer people for its themes of self-discovery and overcoming challenges.

The nod to Celeste resonates deeply within the queer community, evoking a sense of empowerment, determination, and solidarity. It represents the shared experiences and journeys of individuals, encouraging them to reach new heights and conquer their personal mountains.
