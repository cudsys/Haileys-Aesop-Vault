## Wardrobe
The player is able to choose from different **outfits** from their **wardrobe** before leaving their house. Each outfit has certain effects on the story, ranging from adding/removing/altering dialogue all the way to being required to obtain endings.

### PJs
These are pyjamas that the player wears by default at the beginning of the game.
#### Changes
- **Dialogue**
	- People have a slightly high chance to point out that you're still wearing PJs.
	- [[Elle]] will make a joke about sleepovers, but also say that she wouldn't mind having one if the day turns out well.
- **Departing**
	- If the player tries to **depart** without opening their **wardrobe**, the game will remind them that they're still in their PJs and that they should look at their **wardrobe**.
	- If the player HAS opened their **wardrobe** at least once but are still wearing the PJs, the game will prompt them if they really want to **depart** while wearing PJs.
- **Endings**
	- The player is able to obtain **sleepy endings** by going to locations with beds or the ability to lie down.

### Casual clothes
These clothes are super cas and are considered the most regular clothes you can wear, useful for discovering new routes and endings without the risk of altered dialogue.
#### Changes
- **Dialogue**
	- Dialogue is at its most default with this outfit. HOWEVER...
	- Looking in the mirror while wearing this outfit has a \[low]% chance of the game calling you "super cas".
		- Getting this dialogue activates a flag that causes bonus dialogue to appear. A notable example is [[Elle]] offering you a "fun size Twix".
- **Endings**
	- All non-outfit-exclusive endings are obtainable with this outfit.
