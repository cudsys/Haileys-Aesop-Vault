# Hailey's Aesop Vault
Ah! You found us! Yes, this is indeed the very Obsidian vault that houses all the game's secrets. Ideally, I'd have this repository on private, but I *am* the type of person to show off what's happening behind the scenes. So, you're free to poke around if you so wish. You *WILL* spoil the entire game for yourself though, so be warned!
