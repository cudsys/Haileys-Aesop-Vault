- he likes to EMPHASIZE with CAPITALS and not *ITALICS*
- uses slightly bigger than usual/less common words (probably to sound smarter)
- perfect everything. perfect grammer, spelling, punctuation, capitals, the whole shaboom
- examples:
	"My choice of clothing matches who I am: sleek and simple. Unlike you lot, who just want to make everything complicated for seemingly no reason."
    "Remind me as to why you're trying to take pride in a slur again?"
    "For the VERY last time, I am NOT a TWINK. Do I make myself CLEAR?"
