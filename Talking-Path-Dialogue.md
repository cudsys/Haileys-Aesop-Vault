#passage 
OKAY ![üëè](https://discord.com/assets/9fa091f676e4451ee5946fed948cb8fe.svg) this is the talking path now since that leads us to time passes (summit) and THAT passage has multiple ways to get to it

---

MC: i need to go out more often and just...explore.
A: true!! that's how i met *these* two cool cats
MC: ...and Evan?
L: no, you didnt run into him did you?
MC: yeah... Avery kinda got me out of talking with him. saved me some hassle
A: He was trying to convert [pr2] to his shitty heteronormative mindset
M: wait, hang on, hold up
Max holds his hands up as if to further silence any interruption
M: who is this guy?
A: Oh! didn't we tell you Max?
L: I mean, Aves, we met Max like two days ago. he doesnt know all of our lore
A: ah
L: Evan is...a nutcase. Annoying, homophobic, i think transphobic?
A: yeah he's transphobic too. he misgenders me to my face, so its a safe bet
L: ah
A: Essentially you guys, just stay away from him and don't put up with his shit
M: Ah, good to know!
MC: Yeah, thanks for the heads up
L: it's...kinda ironic since well...he looks like a twink
MC: YOOOOOOOOO
A: YOOOOOOOOOOO you did NOT just say that
L: mhm, i did :3
A: holy shit, you're RIGHT tho!
A: ok tbh, if he wasn't a complete asshole, i'd probably be into him

some time passed
some more time passed
the conversation waxed and waned, picked up and put back down
laughs were had, experiences shared, writers block occurred
but all is well in love and war, and all was well in the summit

Eventually, and no one knows how, but time continued to pass. And as patrons of the Summit gradually left this community beacon, a thought occurred to you.

MC: Hey, Avery?
Avery, currently coming last in Wario RaceCars lets out a frustrated breath as they put their controls down, resigned to their defeat.
A: Yeah dude, what's up?
MC: you mentioned earlier that if Evan wasn't a jerk, you'd be into him
A: uhh, yeah that's right? I mean, his fashion could use a little work, and minus the egotistic maniacism, he's kinda cute. 
L: So just, remove Evan from Evan and you'd like him?
Avery snaps her fingers at the Wario RaceCars champion
A: Exactly! so much better
M: wait, but... ok, hold up.
Max pauses the game and turns his attention towards Avery. Lilac lets out a groan (she's winning)
M: didn't you say you weren't into that other guy?
A: right, but I can still like other guys. I don't mind if someone is a guy, girl, or something in between honestly.
M: ...right, cos you're...
A: Pansexual. Gender doesn't play a role in who I'm attracted to, I just find the person attractive.
Something, clicked.
MC: Wait, what?
