# max path baybeee!

okay so the "there has to be a fluid sexuality" option is now "okay hear me out" just for context

---
You: okay, so, hear me out
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
The groups gaze turns to you]
You: okay, so, you know how there's the genderfluid gender identity?
Avery: $v_avery[Uh huh...]
You: what if there was a... sexuality that was fluid?
Max: $v_max[so like, who you're into changes over time in some way?]
You: yeah!
Lilac: $v_lilac[That, does sound like something that would exist...]
Max: $v_max[speaking of fluids, imma use the bathroom, brb]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You all let out a hint of a chuckle as Max takes his leave]
Avery: $v_avery[aight Max, dont get lost :P]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Lilac looks at you.]
Lilac: ...you ever heard of Celeste?
You: omgggg I love that game!
Lilac: we have it here, wanna race?
You: ohhh you're so on


<!--->
Not sure how much of this *should* be narrated because the MC doesn't see it.
Is that why Hailey is narrating for this section?
I have so many questions but you're eepy, so I'll write it out  then let you figure out what to do with it.
<!--->

$v_hailey[On his way toward the bathroom, a figure unfamiliar to Max approaches. White shirt, black pants.]
Evan: $v_evan[Hey! yo!]
Max: $v_max[umm, hi!]
Evan: $v_evan[How're you doing?]
Max: $v_max[Im, ok, I guess? just hea-]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Evan puts his arm around Max's shoulder]
Evan: $v_evan[Cool! that's fantastic, awesome. Could I chat with you for a sec?]
Max: $v_max[uhh, sure? I guess]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Evan leads Max to a set of chairs near the bathroom
The pair sit across from one another]
Max: $v_max[so uh, what'd you wanna talk about?]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Evan hangs his head and lets out a sigh]
Evan: $v_evan[I don't know how you met that lot, but they're not who they make themselves out to be.]
Max: $v_max[..what?]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
A sincere gaze levels with Max's]
Evan: $v_evan[They're a bunch of attention desperate wack jobs who want nothing more than to make the world about them and their fragile egos.]
Max: $v_max[I-I-what? no! They're just people who are misunderstood!]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Evan takes a deep breath as he rests his hands on his kness.]
Evan: $v_evan[...]
Evan: $v_evan[how long have you known them for?]
Max: $v_max[uhh, three days?]
Evan: $v_evan[then it's not too late.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Evan leans forward and gestures Max to come closer.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Max does.]
Evan: $v_evan[They've manipulated you.]
Max: $v_max[WHAT]
Evan: $v_evan[it's all a ruse. There's no real difference between them and any other normal person. They're just desperate for the world to revolve around them and make allowances for how *special* they feel. These inflated egos find each other and all they want is to gain power through social coercion]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Max stands up at this allegation]
Max: $v_max[NO. no, they're people. People are different, and it doesn't help that the society they've been raised in doesn't accommodate for these types of people! It's not fair. It's not *fair*.]
Evan: $v_evan[no! it doesn't accommodate for outcasts who think they're above the natural order. it doesn't accommodate for people who would make themselves the centre of the universe and have an ENTIRE MONTH dedicated to their so called 'liberation'. it doesn't accommodate for people who place themselves above social harmony!]
Evan: $v_evan[it's disgusting. and look at you! a normal, handsome young man and they've gone and used your naivety to their advantage! look how quickly you jumped to their defense when you hardly even know them!]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Max sits back down as if he took a blow to the gut.]
Evan: $v_evan[But it's ok! it's ok, it's not too late. Their coercion didn't have time to get far. ok? no one blames you, they know how to win people to their side, it's a practice of theirs.]
Max: $v_max[but, no. they're just misunderstood, they didn't do anything but talk with me! ]
Evan: $v_evan[how do you think cults start? how do you think they spread their brainrot?]
Max: $v_max[no, nonono]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Head in hands, Max just sits their in silence]
Evan: $v_evan[don't worry, i'll help you out, it's all gonna be ok.]

<!-->
Don't know how fucked you wanted me to go with all of this, but hey
I think this is something good to work off of

ALSO
I know Max hasn't known them for long, so I think having him cry or smth would *probably* be unrealistic. SO yeh!
<!-->

Lilac: $v_lilac[-did he fall in the toilet or something?]
Avery: $v_avery[he's probably just constipated, be patient with him]
You: I mean, do we wanna go check up on him?
Avery: $v_avery:[what, and hear him groaning and panting on the porcelain throne?]
Lilac: $v_lilac[wait]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Lilac pauses Celeste as both you and Avery glance at her.]
Lilac: $v_lilac[didn't you say Evan was in the Mall eariler?]
Avery: $v_avery[yeah? but i doubt he'd have a convo with Max, just doesn't give off those vibes that Evan picks up on.]
You: Still, maybe we should go check?
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Avery groans then stands up]
Avery: $v_avery[fine, but five bucks says he's just taking a dump.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You place down your controller as you grin up at Avery]
You: i'll take that bet.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=7
Avery smirks back, then places their hands in their pockets.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You all take your leave in search of your missing friend.]

---
```twine
Avery: $v_avery[...shit]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
It's as Lilac feared, Evan did find Max and started talking to him.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You all took a breath in as you prepare for the upcoming argument.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
But, nothing could have prepared you for the look of pain and betrayal he held as Max slowly looked at Lilac and Avery.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Initially, Avery and Lilac stand like deer in headlights.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
then Avery takes off toward Max
Lilac: $v_lilac[Avery!]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
She looks at you and grabs your hand.
Lilac: $v_lilac[Come on!]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You rush forward with Lilac as a single thought rings in all of your ears:
What did he *do*?
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Avery reaches the pair first, and kneels beside Max's chair.
Avery: $v_avery[Max! are you ok?]
Max: $v_max[Avery! I-I-]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Evan glares at you as you and Lilac come closer, then mutters
Evan: $v_evan[dammit...]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
You look over at Avery...
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
If looks could kill, Evan'd be in trouble right now.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
The scowl you see etched into Averys face will haunt your dreams for a few nights.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
And Evan is on the receiving end.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
As Avery would so aptly put:
- If he wasn't an asshole, you'd feel sorry for him.
Avery: $v_avery[evan! what did you do?]
Max: *blinks* $v_max[Evan?]
Evan: $v_evan[pfft, nothing that isn't true.]
Lilac: $v_lilac[then why is he looking at us like he's seen a ghost?!]
Evan: $v_evan[Oh, I just let him know that you two abused his naivety and coerced him into being your little. ally. lapdog.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Silence.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Anger.
Avery: $v_avery[you WHAT]
Lilac: $v_lilac[EVAN]
You: COERCED HIM(either:"?!", "!?")
Evan: $v_evan[is that not what you've done?]
Avery: $v_avery[you listen here you little shit]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
They get up and get right in his face.
Avery: $v_avery[you stay AWAY from him!]
Evan: *chuckles* $v_evan[why? so you can continue to brainwash the poor guy? I've opened his eyes more than you ever could]
Avery: $v_avery[you snarky, arrogant bottle of frog piss. What 'arguments' did you bring up this time?]
Lilac: $v_lilac[oh I bet he did the whole "People choose to be gay", it's an evan classic. Something about people thinking their special and choosing this yada yada yada]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Avery stands up, closes their eyes, then immediately gives Evan the *filthiest* look a human can muster.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Note to self: Avery can be scary.
Avery: $v_avery[I'll have you know, you pathetic attempt of an intellectual, that no one CHOOSES their sexuality. They FIGURE IT OUT. In fact, there is *plenty* of scientific literature pointing towards homosexuality in non-human animals, particularly in other social species (https://www.livescience.com/16138-gay-animals-bonobos-dolphins.html)]
Evan: *sweats* $v_evan[right, sure, but its only been recently that tra-]
Avery: $v_avery[shut your mouth. trans people have existed in cultures all around the world throught history, including Emporess Elagabulus(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus). And current scans of the brain of pre-HRT trans people show that their brains are more similar to that of the gender they say they are than what others say they are(Refer to edme, there's a lot of evidence for this :D)]
Evan: $v_evan[But, non-]
Avery: $v_avery["Oh, but what about non-binary people?" you ask, well I'll have you know that there have been a multitude of cultures that respected and integrated third, fourth, and fifth genders into their society(https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/) and being of both or neither a girl/boy was not seen as an issue.]
Evan: *sweating* $v_evan[Y-yeah? well, doesn't change the fact that it's immoral you heathens!]
Lilac: $v_lilac[Here's a quick philosophy lesson, EVAN. For something to be moral or immoral, it first needs to a) be a conscious activity, and b) affect community wellbeing. Even if you *could* choose to be part of the rainbow mafia, you'd still need to prove how it negatively affects people for it to even be *in* the argument of morality.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Silence.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Evan: *eyes darting about* $v_evan[y-yeah? w-well,]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Max: $v_max[Can it, Evan.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
All eyes drift to Max.
He's out of his chair, and a look of indignation and determination rests behind his eyes.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Max: $v_max[I'm happy I had this conversation with you, cos it really shows how much of a lowly scumbag you are, claiming things about people when hardly even knowing anything about them.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
He puts his arm around Avery, who blinks.
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Max: $v_max[So just, leave dude. I have some friends to lose Celeste to.]
(t8n:"dissolve")+(after:time+$dialogueSpeed)[=
Evan looks at Max, then at you, and avoids eye contact with Avery as he gets out of his seat, then walks off.

- lilac: that does sound like something that exists
- max: actually, speaking of fluids, im gonna go got the bathroom brb
- the group giggles a little.
- avery: aight
- max heads off to the bathroom
- lilac looks at you.
- lilac: you ever heard of celeste?
- you: omg i love that game
- lilac: they have celeste here. wanna race?
- you: you're on
- if mc knows hailey, 50/50 chance of this appearing: [[meanwhile...]] (skip this for now and just work on the next dot point) narration is in $v_hailey
    
    - as max walks to the bathroom, a tall-ish guy in black and white approaches.
        
        - evan: yo
        - max: hi! ummm
        - evan: how're u doing?
        - max: im okay i guess. just hea-
        - evan: that's good. can i chat with you for a sec?
        - max: i mean, sure i guess.
        - evan and max sit down outside the entrance to the bathrooms.
        - todo: finish this
        
    
- some time passes and max still isn't back from the bathroom yet.
- lilac: hey um..max has been gone for a while.
- you: true..
- you: should we go check on him?
- lilac: thats a good idea.
- you pause the game and both of you get up and walk over to avery.
- lilac: max has been gone for a while so were gonna go find him
- avery: oh true, ill come with then

- avery: ...shit.
- avery starts running towards them.
- you: huh?
- lilac also realizes.
- lilac: evan's talking to max. cmon!
- lilac grabs your hand and you both run over with avery.
- avery: max! are you okay?
- max: *looks at avery* oh hey avery!
- evan: *mutters* (text-size:0.6)[dammit..]
- okay so for this part im gonna let you freestyle a bit. avery and evan are supposed to have some form of debate to kinda "bring max back" and of course avery wins.
- so after that:
- max: thanks for saving me, aves.
- avery: s'all good. thought we lost u for a moment there!
- lilac: that would have been scary..
- you: yeah...but all's well that ends well!
- max: agreed
- the group begin heading back to the summit.
- avery: oh! that reminds me! while you and lilac were playing celeste, i did a bit of research and turns out there _is_ a fluid sexuality. it's called abrosexual!
- avery hands you her phone, showing a page about abrosexuality.
- aaand i've ran out of ideas
