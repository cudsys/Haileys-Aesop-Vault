# Reflect
**Reflecting** allows the player to specify their gender in two parts. First, the player physically reflects by looking at their body in the mirror to acknowledges its features. It is at this point that the player can decide what **assigned sex** they wish to be canon for the current run. After which, they mentally reflect, allowing the player to decide on the player character's **gender identity**. This system allows you to be cisgender, transgender, nonbinary and intersex. While some endings can be achieved with all genders, other endings are gender-exclusive.
