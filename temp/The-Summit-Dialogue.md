#passage
remember each character's traits and quirks lilac is shy, says less per piece of dialogue and uses no apostrophes period (or capitals). max is upbeat, willing to learn and pretty funny. i....dunno how he'd speak so i guess experiment once you got the actual words down??

After a minute of companionable silence, you and Avery start chatting. It's not anything spectacular, and as time passes you start to feel more eager about meeting their friends.

The pair of you begin to climb the levels of the Mall, passing the sights and sounds of a bustling plaza. Continuing to make your path upwards, you can't really think of much that's this high up in the mall. There's the toy store, a bookstore, and an old art exhibit that started years ago but never got much traction.

Where could this spot be?

As your head peaks over the last escalator, your question was answered.

Avery: Welcome to... the Summit!

Where the art exhibit once stood, was a place you had never seen, let alone heard others talk about before.

What was once a large open space committed to modern art had been transformed into an even larger space with couches, beanbags, and blankets, with the large windows showcasing the city skyline only exaggerating the openness of the area. The walls were adorned with a multitude of flags that you could tell had a meaning and history to each of them, and a single pole connecting the floor to the roof in the centre of the space with a single flag being hung from the top, a red flag you haven't seen before.

As Avery leads you inside, no one glares at you, only looking with welcoming smiles and latent curiosity. No one is getting in your face, but there are words of affirmation scribbled on the walls every inch of furniture. You can't smell fear or anger, but rather the comforting aroma coming from the tea station to the right of the room.

[Look out window]

You gaze out of the window and just, wow.

[2] You go back to the window and just, wow.

[Sit down with Avery's Friends]
A: So, yeah! welcome to our happy place
MC: its-this place is amazing
A: mm! ah! and these are my friends: Lilac and Max
L: hiihiihiihellooo
M: helooooo!
Max turns his focus away before pumping himself up
M: okay Max, you know the drill, just gotta ask for their pronouns. you got this
Avery chuckles before gesturing towards Lilac
A: Lilac here is a demigal and uses she/her and they/them pronouns
Lilac gives a little wave
A: And Max here is our baby ally and uses he/him pronouns
M: hey there! still got a bit to learn, but ey! what're your pronouns?
MC: um, hey! i use [pr1]/[pr2]
Turns to Lilac
M: crushed it
*self-five*
Laughter erupts from everyone in the group before you and Avery take a seat.
MC: So, how have I never heard of this place?
L: Well, you know how this used to be an art exhibit? Well, one of the mayors kids saw the potential for a community project and took it upon themselves to just, make this a dedicated youth space.
MC: omg that's so cool!
A: right?  i love it when community projects turn out so well
M: oh! remember that one that popped up for a few weeks last month? man, that place was so cool-

You get lost in the conversation as your mind drifts back to your thoughts. The chatter of the three friends fading away as you start to wonder,
Can they help me?
Should I bring up my problem?
I don't wanna overshare...
but they seem friendly?
Could they...

A few minutes pass by in this state, before you feel a tap on your shoulder.

A: Hey you alright? It looks like you want to say something

Your eyes focus back to the three people you're with as you filter through the last few minutes of conversation for a talking point.

And, you find a few:
