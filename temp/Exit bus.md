You get off the bus and are met with a nice, green front yard. You make your way towards the door.
- You feel excited to meet Elle.
- You feel nervous, but nonetheless excited to meet Elle.

# Knock
- You give the front door three good knocks.
- You give the front door a good shave-and-a-haircut knock.

You hear a voice yell "Coming!" followed by footsteps gradually getting closer. The door opens and you see a pretty girl with nice long brown hair and a smile on her face.
